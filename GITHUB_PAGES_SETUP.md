# ðŸ”§ GitHub Pages Manual Setup Guide

## Issue Identified âœ…
The GitHub Actions workflow was configured with a custom domain that might be causing deployment issues. I've fixed this by removing the custom domain configuration.

## Required Manual Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings

You need to manually configure GitHub Pages settings:

1. **Go to Repository Settings:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/CF-LLC/RogueCoinGame/settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar

2. **Configure Source:**
   - **Source:** Select "GitHub Actions" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - This is crucial for the deployment to work

3. **Save Settings:**
   - Click "Save" if there's a save button

### 2. Verify GitHub Actions Permissions

1. **Check Actions Permissions:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/CF-LLC/RogueCoinGame/settings/actions
   - Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected
   - Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"

### 3. Monitor Deployment

1. **Check Actions Tab:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/CF-LLC/RogueCoinGame/actions
   - Look for the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Should show recent runs after the push

2. **Expected URL:**
   - Once deployed: https://cf-llc.github.io/RogueCoinGame/

## Troubleshooting

### If Actions Don't Run:
- Check if GitHub Actions are enabled for the repository
- Verify workflow permissions include write access
- Ensure the workflow file is in the correct location: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### If Deployment Fails:
- Check the Actions logs for specific error messages
- Verify the `out` directory is being generated during build
- Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"

### If Site Shows 404:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
- Check if GitHub Pages is enabled
- Verify the basePath configuration in `next.config.ts`

## What I Fixed

âœ… **Removed Custom Domain:** The workflow was trying to use `roguecoin.pages.dev` which could cause issues
âœ… **Pushed Latest Code:** All changes are now on the main branch
âœ… **Build Verified:** Local build produces correct static files in `out/` directory

## Next Steps After Manual Configuration

Once you've enabled GitHub Pages in the repository settings:

1. **Trigger Deployment:** The latest push should trigger the workflow
2. **Check Status:** Monitor the Actions tab for deployment progress
3. **Test Site:** Visit https://cf-llc.github.io/RogueCoinGame/ once deployed

## Alternative: Manual Deployment

If GitHub Actions continue to have issues, you can deploy manually:

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# The 'out' directory contains the static files
# Upload these to any static hosting service
```

The application is fully ready - it just needs GitHub Pages to be properly configured in the repository settings!
