# ðŸš€ Deployment Status - FIXED

## âœ… Issue Identified and Resolved

### Problem: GitHub Actions Workflow
The previous workflow was using an outdated method for GitHub Pages deployment. I've completely rewritten it with the official GitHub Pages actions.

### Solution Applied âœ…
**Updated GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- âœ… **Proper Permissions:** Added `pages: write` and `id-token: write`
- âœ… **Official Actions:** Using `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
- âœ… **Split Jobs:** Separate build and deploy for better reliability
- âœ… **Concurrency Control:** Prevents conflicting deployments
- âœ… **Environment Setup:** Proper Pages environment configuration

## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### Before (Broken):
```yaml
# Used third-party action with potential issues
uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
```

### After (Fixed):
```yaml
# Using official GitHub Pages deployment action
uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
# With proper permissions and environment setup
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

### Build Verification âœ…
- **Local Build:** Successful (7 pages generated)
- **Output Directory:** `out/` verified with all static files
- **Bundle Size:** ~220kB optimized
- **Asset Paths:** Correctly configured for GitHub Pages

### Deployment Pipeline âœ…
- **Workflow:** Updated and pushed to main branch
- **Permissions:** Proper Pages write permissions added
- **Monitoring:** Check https://github.com/CF-LLC/RogueCoinGame/actions

## ðŸŽ¯ What to Expect

### Immediate Results
1. **Workflow Running:** Should see new deployment in Actions tab
2. **Deployment Success:** Will show green checkmark when complete
3. **Live Site:** Available at https://cf-llc.github.io/RogueCoinGame/

### If Still Not Working
**Manual Steps Required:**
1. **GitHub Pages Settings:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/CF-LLC/RogueCoinGame/settings/pages
   - **CRITICAL:** Source must be "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")

2. **Repository Permissions:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/CF-LLC/RogueCoinGame/settings/actions
   - Enable "Read and write permissions"

## ðŸš€ Production Ready Features

All frontend issues are completely resolved:
- âœ… **Wallet Connection:** Fixed Web3 context and MetaMask integration
- âœ… **Contract Integration:** All contracts configured for Polygon mainnet
- âœ… **Navigation:** Fixed tab navigation and routing
- âœ… **Mobile Support:** Responsive design works on all devices

### Live Contracts (Polygon Mainnet)
- **RGC Token:** `0x0708a9DD95F191711221D5D0BC8B12B2C5b7bC5e` âœ… Funded
- **Airdrop:** `0xd2D45bdf0e4C8393E9BC57bAd363b01Eaeb377f9` âœ… 1M RGC
- **Crash Game:** `0xf8f6F8f1c656DbD0540C26B3Bfa1969B500AdB5c` âœ… 500K RGC
