sed -i 's/NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=137/NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=80001/' .env

# Deploy and test
npm run compile
npm run deploy:mumbai
```

### 2. Get Security Audit

3. **GET** a security audit before mainnet launch
4. **USE** multisig wallets for admin functions
5. **BACKUP** all deployment information
6. **COMMUNICATE** clearly with community
